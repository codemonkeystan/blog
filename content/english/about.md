**I build software and web-related stuff**

I generally code in Java and Golang. I've done quite a bit Node, Ruby and Python too. Part of my fullstack knowledge includes Angular, React and Vue. I also do devops (docker, k8s, CI/CD, etc.), software architecture and infrastructure setup.

Recently, I've also been learning Rust. If you're a Rust champion, feel free to connect! 

I wish to not only explain coding tips, but also coding interview techniques and tips for newbies on the ins and outs of programming. Hopefully, my articles and case studies will help your learn coding better, and maybe get a decent gig or job.
